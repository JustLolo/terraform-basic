## Fix all the issues I have when I merged this to github

* Terraform tested on Windows
* Move the terraform project to a separate folder inside the whole project (documentation using various projects), test the functionality (terraform init/apply), if it works, commit the work.
* Fix internal terraform documentation
* Add the functionality of save/sync the home folder of EC2 to S3
